# Python_Hangman_Tkinter
### Hello !!
This is the Project I had made for my Python Programming Assignment last year using Tkinter for GUI.

Hangman is a guessing game for 2 players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. 

I have added images of a Man that change according to the user input. One has to guess a 5 letter word and will get 6 tries for the same. After the last try, the image of the man 
dead on a Guillotine will be visible but if we're successful in guessing the word, the GUI will show the image of the man wearing a crown.
